# DistributedML
Goal: Explore different schemes of distributed machine learning through simulation
Steps Taken:
1. Get an approximate probability distribution on a sample computer (worker) on cost in time to calculate gradient for 1 training example
2. Set up distributed ML schemes where each worker draws from the probability distribution to get time cost
3. Compare different scehemes for performance such as time to convergence
